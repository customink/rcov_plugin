rcov_plugin
===========

This is a simple rails plugin for Rails that adds some useful rcov rake tasks.

    rake test:coverage                # Tests coverage on the entire application
    rake test:coverage:units          # Tests coverage for unit tests
    rake test:coverage:functionals    # Tests coverage for functional tests
    rake test:coverage:integration    # Tests coverage for integration tests

The task ends up creating a coverage folder with an html coverage report in it.

SHOW_ONLY is a comma-separated list of the files you'd like to see (although
you can only run functionals, you still see all the models and helpers which 
are 'touched'). Right now there are four types of files rake test:coverage 
recognizes: models, helpers, controllers, and lib. These can be abbreviated 
to their first letters:

    rake test:coverage SHOW_ONLY=models
    rake test:coverage SHOW_ONLY=helpers,controllers
    rake test:coverage SHOW_ONLY=h,c

Installing
=============
As of Rails 3, rake tasks can be distributed easily in plugins packaged as gems, and that's what we do here. So, to install rcov_plugin, simply do:

gem install rcov_plugin

or add the gem to your bundler Gemspec

gem "rcov_plugin"

JRuby Support
=============
rcov_plugin works great with JRuby.

If using JRuby, remember to run rake with it, like this:
    jruby -S rake test:coverage

Special thanks go to Leonard Borges ([http://www.leonardoborges.com](http://www.leonardoborges.com)) for getting the plugin working with JRuby.

Requirements
============

This plugin requires rails 3 and 

Using With Rails 2
============
Just add the gem to your Gemfile like in Rails 3 (you are using Bundler with Rails 2 aren't you?)
